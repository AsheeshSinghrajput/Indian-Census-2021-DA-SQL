# Indian-Census-2021-DA-SQL

## Project Objective 
I worked on the Indian Census 2021 dataset, which is divided into two parts:Dataset 1: District, State, Growth, Sex Ratio, Literacy ,Dataset 2: City, State, Area (in kmÂ²), Population ,using these datasets,
I derived insights related to population distribution, sex ratio, education levels, male-female demographics, and gender comparisons. To achieve this, I applied a wide range of advanced SQL techniques, including window functions, joins, subqueries, CTEs, HAVING clauses, and other aggregate operations.

## Questions (KPIs)
### EASY LEVEL 
- Question 1. How many rows are in our dataset?
- Question 2. Find the datasets only for Jharkhand and Bihar.
- Question 3. Population of India.
- Question 4. What is the average growth rate of the Indian population?
- Question 5. What is the average growth rate of the state population?
- Question 6. What is avg sex_ration per state?
- Question 7. What is avg literacy_rate per state ?
- Question 8. Find the literacy>90 in terms of states.
- Question 10. Find the state that starts with the letter 'a' or 'b'.
- Question 11. Find the state that starts with the letter 'A' and ends with the letter 'h'.

### MODERATE LEVEL
- Question 1. Find the total number of Female and Male populations?
- Question 2. Find out state level total number of male and female population.
- Question 3. Which state's Literacy rate is the highest.
- Question 4. Find out the total number of literate and illiterate  people for each state.
- Question 5. Find out the previous year population state-wise.
- Question 6. How many person on per kilometer in previous year and the current year?
- Question 7. Find the top 3 districts of each state that have the highest literacy rate.
