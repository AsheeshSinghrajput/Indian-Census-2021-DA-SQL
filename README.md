# Indian-Census-2021-DA-SQL

## Project Objective 
I worked on the Indian Census 2021 dataset, which is divided into two parts:Dataset 1: District, State, Growth, Sex Ratio, Literacy ,Dataset 2: City, State, Area (in kmÂ²), Population ,using these datasets,
I derived insights related to population distribution, sex ratio, education levels, male-female demographics, and gender comparisons. To achieve this, I applied a wide range of advanced SQL techniques, including window functions, joins, subqueries, CTEs, HAVING clauses, and other aggregate operations.
